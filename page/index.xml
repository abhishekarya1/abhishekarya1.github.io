      <description>img { max-width:300px; max-height:200px; width: auto; height: auto; }  My name is Abhishek Arya. Some things about me, including but not limited to, love for computers :
 I absolutely hate small talks and avoid them completely, no offence. ðŸ™‚ I am a typical neighbourhood geek - vsauce, xkcd, Cyanide &amp;amp; Happiness, watching rocket launches when I&amp;rsquo;m bored, paradoxes and thought experiments. I am on a journey to discover my true passion in computer sciences and technology, which hopefully I can find somewhere here on the internet.</description>

This list will be updated regularly as I discover more stuff.
