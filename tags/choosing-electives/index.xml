      <description>It is mandatory for students of computer sciences in their fifth semester to choose an elective course as electives are a great learning opportunity for students to learn something that is actually useful in real-life.
Developing apps and websites, learning new technologies are all a part of the learning experience. It is advised that you choose your elective course carefully after being aware of what to expect from the course and what you want to do after it.</description>
