      <description>&amp;ldquo;Learning is fun&amp;rdquo;, they say. Well, I beg to differ. Learning new things is frustrating, it is uncomforting at best. If you&amp;rsquo;re learning a new word, you can just attach a silly memory or wordplay with it and it&amp;rsquo;s there in your mind now and when you start using it daily, it sticks. But, this is not the case with other things such as sciences. Fields of study such as Economics, Biology, Mathematics, and Computer Sciences, enable you to solve real-life problems.</description>

I started building it and learnt many things along the way, I set up the hosting and the domain and finally got it running.</description>
